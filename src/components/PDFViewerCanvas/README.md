### Summary of `PDFViewerCanvas` React Component

The `PDFViewerCanvas` component is used for rendering a PDF document onto a canvas and includes navigation through the PDF pages. It provides loading, error handling, and navigation functionalities, making it flexible for displaying PDF files with page navigation controls.

### Key Features:

1. **PDF Loading and Rendering**: Uses `pdfjsLib` to fetch and render a PDF onto an HTML5 canvas.
2. **Navigation**: Includes navigation between pages using the `DifferenceNavigation` component.
3. **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the PDF fails to load.
4. **Loading Indicator**: A loading spinner is displayed while the PDF is being fetched and rendered.
5. **Customizable Canvas Attributes**: Accepts additional attributes for customization, like CSS classes and style properties.

### State Variables:

- `loading`: A boolean indicating if the PDF is still loading.
- `numberOfPages`: The total number of pages in the PDF.
- `currentPage`: Tracks the current page being rendered.
- `errorMessage`: Holds any error message in case the PDF fails to load.

### Props:

- **`src`**: The source URL or file for the PDF document.
- **`className`**: An optional class name for styling the canvas.
- **`documentName`**: The name of the document, used for slugifying the `id` of the canvas.
- **`pageNumber`**: The page number to display initially (default: 1).
- **`showNavigation`**: A boolean to control whether navigation is displayed (default: true).
- **`...attributes`**: Additional attributes passed to the canvas element.

### Main Functional Logic:

- **PDF Fetching**:
  - The `loadPDF` function fetches the PDF using the `pdfjsLib.getDocument()` method.
  - The PDF is rendered using `renderPage()` which takes the page number, fetches the respective page, and draws it on the canvas.
- **Page Rendering Queue**:
  - The `queueRenderPage` method ensures that pages are rendered sequentially, preventing multiple render operations from overlapping.

### Error and Loading Handling:

- The component shows a loading indicator while the PDF is fetched, and an error message if the PDF fails to load.

### Example Usage:

```jsx
<PDFViewerCanvas
  src="/path/to/pdf/document.pdf"
  className="pdf-viewer"
  documentName="example-document"
  pageNumber={1}
  showNavigation={true}
/>
```

### Conclusion:

This component is well-suited for use cases where PDFs need to be viewed on a webpage with navigation between pages. It includes a flexible interface and handles common scenarios such as loading, error states, and navigating through multiple pages.
