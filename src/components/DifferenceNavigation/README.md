### Summary of `DifferenceNavigation` React Component

The `DifferenceNavigation` component is a reusable navigation control designed for stepping through a series of items, such as pages, variations, or other items in sequence. It is particularly useful for navigating between previous and next items in a list. This component can be easily customized with different labels and used for navigation in various contexts.

#### Props

- **`differenceId` (number)**: The current index or ID of the item being displayed (e.g., current page or variation).
- **`setDifferenceFocus` (function)**: A callback function to change the current item focus. It is invoked when a user clicks the next or previous button to switch between items.
- **`totalDifferences` (number)**: The total number of items to navigate through. This value is used to disable buttons at the start and end of the navigation.
- **`keyword` (string)** _(optional)_: A term used to label the navigation. Defaults to `"variation"`. It is displayed in the label between the next and previous buttons.
- **`plural` (string)** _(optional)_: A plural form of the keyword used for the message when there are no items to display. Defaults to `"variations"`.

#### Key Features

- **Next and Previous Buttons**: The component displays "Previous" and "Next" buttons for navigating through items. These buttons are disabled when the user is at the beginning or end of the list.
- **Labeling**: In the middle, a label is displayed, indicating the current position within the list (e.g., "Variation 1 of 5").
- **Customizability**: The text for the buttons and label can be customized via the `keyword` prop, making this component flexible for different contexts.

#### Example Usage

```jsx
<DifferenceNavigation
  differenceId={2}
  setDifferenceFocus={handleFocusChange}
  totalDifferences={5}
  keyword="page"
  plural="pages"
/>
```

In this example:

- The navigation is for "pages" instead of the default "variations".
- The current page is 2, and there are 5 pages total.
- The buttons will call `handleFocusChange` to update the current page, and the label will display "Page 2 of 5".

#### Conditional Rendering

- If there are no items to display (i.e., `totalDifferences === 0`), the component renders a message indicating that no items were found.

#### Custom Button Rendering

- The buttons are rendered using a helper method `renderButton`, which accepts an `id`, `onClick` function, `disabled` state, and `content` to allow for consistent button rendering and styling.
