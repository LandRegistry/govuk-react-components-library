# Architectural Considerations for @hmlr/govuk-react-component-library

## 1. Component Architecture

### 1.1 Atomic Design Principles

- Implement atomic design methodology to organize components.
- Categorize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
- Ensure each component is self-contained and reusable.

### 1.2 Component Structure

- Each component should have its own directory containing:
  - Main component file (TSX)
  - Styles (SCSS)
  - Tests (TSX)
  - Stories (TSX)
  - Types (TSX)
  - Configuration (TSX)
- Use index files for clean exports and imports.

### 1.3 Stateless vs. Stateful Components

- Prefer stateless functional components where possible.
- Use hooks for state management in functional components.
- Limit the use of class components to scenarios where lifecycle methods are absolutely necessary.

## 2. State Management

### 2.1 Local State

- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component-level state management.
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or state management libraries for deeply nested components.

### 2.2 Global State

- Consider using React Context API for light global state management.
- For more complex state requirements, integrate with external state management libraries like Redux or MobX.

## 3. Styling Architecture

### 3.1 CSS Methodology

- Adopt a BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes.
- Use SCSS for advanced styling features and better organization.

### 3.2 Theming

- Implement a theming system using CSS variables or a styling solution like styled-components.
- Ensure all components adhere to the GOV.UK Design System color palette and typography.

### 3.3 Responsive Design

- Use mobile-first approach for responsive designs.
- Implement flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## 4. Performance Considerations

### 4.1 Code Splitting

- Utilize dynamic imports and React.lazy for code splitting.
- Implement route-based code splitting for larger applications using this library.

### 4.2 Memoization

- Use React.memo for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Implement useMemo and useCallback hooks to optimize performance in complex components.

### 4.3 Virtual DOM Optimization

- Keep component trees shallow to optimize reconciliation.
- Use keys properly in lists to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.

## 5. Accessibility (a11y)

### 5.1 ARIA Attributes

- Implement proper ARIA roles, states, and properties in all components.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

### 5.2 Color Contrast

- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standard color contrast ratios.
- Provide sufficient color contrast for text and important graphics.

### 5.3 Screen Reader Compatibility

- Test all components with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
- Provide meaningful alt text for images and aria-label for interactive elements.

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Testing

- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%).

### 6.2 Integration Testing

- Use Cypress or similar tools for integration testing.
- Test component interactions and flows that span multiple components.

### 6.3 Visual Regression Testing

- Implement visual regression tests using tools like Percy or Chromatic.
- Ensure UI consistency across different browsers and devices.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 Storybook

- Use Storybook for component documentation and visual testing.
- Implement addons for accessibility checks, responsive views, and actions.

### 7.2 JSDoc

- Use JSDoc comments for detailed documentation of component props, methods, and types.
- Generate API documentation from JSDoc comments.

## 8. Build and Bundle

### 8.1 Module Formats

- Support multiple module formats (CommonJS, ES modules) for maximum compatibility.
- Use Rollup for efficient tree-shaking and smaller bundle sizes.

### 8.2 Optimization

- Implement code minification and tree shaking in the build process.
- Use babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types to remove PropTypes in production builds.

## 9. Versioning and Release Strategy

### 9.1 Semantic Versioning

- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for releasing new versions.
- Clearly document breaking changes in major version bumps.

### 9.2 Changelog

- Maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.md file.
- Use tools like conventional commits to automate changelog generation.

## 10. Internationalization (i18n)

### 10.1 Text Externalization

- Externalize all user-facing strings for easy translation.
- Use a i18n library like react-intl for managing translations.

### 10.2 RTL Support

- Ensure components support right-to-left (RTL) languages.
- Use logical properties (e.g., margin-inline-start instead of margin-left) for better RTL support.

## 11. Security Considerations

### 11.1 Input Sanitization

- Implement proper input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use libraries like DOMPurify when rendering user-generated content.

### 11.2 Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like npm audit to identify and fix security issues in dependencies.

These architectural considerations provide a comprehensive framework for developing and maintaining the @hmlr/govuk-react-component-library. They ensure the library is robust, performant, accessible, and aligned with modern React and web development best practices.

## Architectural notes

### Level 1: Context Diagram

The context diagram provides a high-level view of the system and its interactions with external entities.

- **System**: HMLR React Components Library
  - **Description**: A library of React components based on GDS specifications for use in UK government digital services.
- **External Systems/Actors**:
  - **Developers**: Use the library to build applications.
  - **GitHub**: Hosts the source code and manages version control.
  - **GitLab CI/CD**: Automates testing and deployment processes.
  - **Users**: End-users who interact with applications built using the library.

### Level 2: Container Diagram

The container diagram shows the high-level technology choices and how the system is structured.

- **Containers**:
  - **React Components Library**: The main codebase containing reusable React components.
    - **Technologies**: React, TypeScript, govuk-frontend
  - **Storybook**: A tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation.
    - **Technologies**: Storybook, React
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates testing and deployment.
    - **Technologies**: GitLab CI/CD, Docker
  - **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the Storybook for public access.
    - **Technologies**: GitHub Pages, gh-pages

### Level 3: Component Diagram

The component diagram provides a more detailed view of the internal structure of the main container (React Components Library).

- **Components**:
  - **DateInput Component**: A reusable date input field.
  - **TaskList Component**: A component for displaying task lists.
  - **PDFViewerCanvas Component**: A component for rendering PDF documents.
  - **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities used across components.
  - **Configuration**: Configuration files for Babel, ESLint, and TypeScript.

### Level 4: Code Diagram

The code diagram provides a detailed view of the internal structure of a specific component or module. This level is often represented by class diagrams or code snippets.

- **Example**: DateInput Component
  - **Files**:
    - `DateInput.tsx`: The main component file.
    - `DateInput.scss`: Styles specific to the DateInput component.
    - `DateInput.test.tsx`: Test cases for the DateInput component.
    - `DateInput.stories.tsx`: Storybook stories for the DateInput component.
